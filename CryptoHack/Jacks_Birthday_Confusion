from math import factorial

# number of trials
n = 2048

# go through the values 0 to n-1
for i in range(n):
	# using the binomial coefficient formula, calculate the probability of the most "i" results in the "n" trials
	flag = 1 - factorial(n) / (factorial(n - i)*pow(n,i))

	# see if the probability is greater than 0.75
	if flag > 0.75:

		print(i) # print value "i"
		break # terminate the loop
